You are editing the landing page copy in a config-driven repo.

Task: rewrite all copy in `src/config/content.ts` to match this vibe:
<VIBE>

Rules:
- Keep the object shape compatible with `ContentConfig` (`src/config/types.ts`).
- Do not change section IDs.
- Keep tone neutral and open-source friendly (no aggressive sales language).
- Keep copy short and clearly editable.

Sections to rewrite (only text fields):
- hero: headline/subheadline/CTA labels/stats labels+values
- socialProof: title/note/logos (logos can be placeholders)
- features: title/description/items[]
- howItWorks: title/description/steps[]
- testimonials: title/description/items[]
- faq: title/description/items[]
- cta: title/description/CTA labels

Output:
- A single patch updating `src/config/content.ts`.
