Audit this Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind landing page for accessibility and performance.

Constraints:
- Do not add heavy new dependencies.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Keep UI components small and semantic.

Do:
1) Identify any missing semantic landmarks, heading order issues, or focus problems.
2) Check interactive elements (buttons/links) for accessible names and keyboard usability.
3) Review motion/animation usage for reduced-motion handling.
4) Look for obvious performance issues (unnecessary re-renders, heavy assets, blocking work).

Output:
- A concise list of findings.
- Minimal patches to fix the top issues (keep changes focused).
